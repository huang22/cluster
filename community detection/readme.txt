FN.py:
  FN.py is the implement of FN lagorithm.
  With filename = "Dataset", we can run the algorithm on the 34*34 dataset; while filename = "footballEdges", we can run it on the dataset with 115 nodes.
  First figure is initial dataset, and then the set of communities. The second figure is the communities.

Fast.py
  Fast.py is the implement of Fast Unfolding algorithm.
  With filename = "Dataset", we can run the algorithm on the 34*34 dataset; while filename = "footballEdges", we can run it on the dataset with 115 nodes.
  First figure is initial dataset, and then the set of communities. The second figure is the communities.

LPA.py
  LPA.py is the implement of LPA algorithm.
  With filename = "Dataset", we can run the algorithm on the 34*34 dataset; while filename = "footballEdges", we can run it on the dataset with 115 nodes.
  First figure is initial dataset, and then the set of communities. The second figure is the communities.



  With or without initial labels, the algorithm will lead to different result. These 3 algorithms are all able to obtain great results in short time, and the implements of these algorithms are easy.
