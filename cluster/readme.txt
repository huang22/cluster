KMeans.py
 It is the implement of KMeans algorithm.
 Run it, you will see the figure of clusters and dataset. The centroids will also be printed.
 You can change the data set(loadDataSet('Data/ringData.txt') or loadDataSet('Data/Gaussian.txt')) in the main function. 
 The cluster number(k should be small than 10, that it can be ploted) is also can be changed in the main function.

SC.py
 It is the implement of the Spectral Clustering.
 Run it, you will see the figure of clusters and dataset. The centroids will also be printed.
 The first figure is in the eigenvalue space, and the second figure is in the initial data space.
 You can change the data set(loadDataSet('Data/ringData.txt') or loadDataSet('Data/Gaussian.txt')) in the main function. 
 The cluster number(cluster should be small than 10, that it can be ploted) is also can be changed in the main function.
